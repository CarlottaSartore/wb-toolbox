# Contributing to WB-Toolbox

First off, thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to WB-Toolbox. This project is developed at the Italian Institute of Technology and it is part of our [robotology](https://github.com/robotology) organization.

Keep in mind that the following are mostly guidelines, not strict rules. Use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. This project is not yet mature as other ones inside our organization, we'd be glad to hear your voice.

## License

All files should contain a license heading:

This software may be modified and distributed under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or any later version.

## Code Style

### C++

We enforce a project-wise C++ style based on [clang-format](/.clang-format). For accepting your PR, your code should be formatted accordingly. Most IDEs nowadays support this tool out-of-the-box and configuring it should be straightforward.

Furthermore:

- All files should use UNIX end of lines.
- Include only what you use. If you are unsure, use the [iwyu](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use) tool.
- The [pimpl pattern](https://cpppatterns.com/patterns/pimpl.html) is recommended.
- Add an empty line between project, system headers, and `std` headers.
- Forward-declare classes into namespaces.
- Do not use `#pragma once`, use instead `#ifndef ... #define ... #endif` macro.
- The defines macros should have the `WBT_<CLASSNAME>_H` format.
- The final `#endif` should have a comment containing the closed `#ifndef`.
- When possible, use explicit declaration and explicit instantiation of templates.
- When not possible, use [three-files `-inl.h`](http://drake.mit.edu/cxx_inl.html) pattern approach.

Example:

```cpp
#ifndef WBT_JACOBIAN_H
#define WBT_JACOBIAN_H

#include "Jacobian.h"
#include "RobotInterface.h"
#include "Signal.h"

#include <iDynTree/Core/EigenHelpers.h>
#include <iDynTree/Core/SpatialMomentum.h>
#include <iDynTree/KinDynComputations.h>

#include <ostream>

namespace wbt {
    class Jacobian;
} // namespace wbt

class wbt::Jacobian
{
...

#endif // WBT_JACOBIAN_H
```

### CMake

- 4 spaces indentation (no tabs).
- Lowercase comments, i.e. `if` instead `IF`.
- No spaces between commands and brakets and do not repeat the argument in the closing blocks, i.e. `if(FOO) ... else() ... endif()`.
- No whitespaces at the end of lines.
- One EOL at the end of the file.
- All files should use UNIX end of lines.

### Git

- Try to comply as much as possible to GitFlow branching model (no need to use external tools).
- Do not push merges generated by `git pull`. Always `pull --rebase`.
- Always check what you are pushing using some graphic tool (`qgit`, `gitg`, `gitk`, `sourcetree`, `gitkraken`).
- Keep commits small and do one and only one thing in each commit, which should be documented with optional but appreciated commit description.
- Use `rebase -i` and `amend` to rewrite your local history and keep it clean.
- Never force-push on the `master` and `devel` branches unless there is a very good reason to do it.

## Documentation

- All the new classes and methods of your PR should contain the doxygen documentation in their headers. For checking its render before pushing, a possible way is the following:
   ```bash
   # From the build directory:
   make dox
   cd doc/doxygen/html
   python -m http.server
   # Browse to http://localhost:8000
   ```
- Your PR should add a changelog in the [doc/release](/doc/release) file of the upcoming version.

## Policies

## Versioning

After an assessment period, with few releases without any defined versioning policy, starting from the release `4` WB-Toolbox follows the following pattern:

#### Major releases, e.g. `4`

- We use a fast rollout numbering, publishing a new major release every devel freeze. This happens when we decide that the amount of new features are worth a new release.
- Major releases may or may not break APIs. Read [Deprecations](#deprecations) for further information.

#### Minor releases, e.g. `4.1`

- Minor releases may contain hot-fixes applied directly to `master` (and then merged to `devel`).
- APIs stability is preserved.

## Deprecations

The following policy is still a rule-of-thumb. We are not yet enforcing it, but soon we will. Take note of it because this will be valid as soon as we reach an acceptable API stability.

- Functions and classes which are marked as deprecated in one major release will be kept at least for another major release. This means that a deprecated class in version `4` will still be present in version `5`, but it might be deleted in version `6`.
