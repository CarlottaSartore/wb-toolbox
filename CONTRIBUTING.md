# Notes on issues
When filing new issues you can use the `create_issue.sh` script (https://github.com/robotology-playground/WB-Toolbox/blob/master/create_issue.sh). The script will open a new page in your preferred browser with some important information for us to debug the problem.
To make this script executable, move to the repository main folder and type `chmod +x create_issue.sh`.

# Contribute to the library
If you want to contribute to the Library (i.e. create a new block, fixing issues, etc), you should start by creating a relative issue, so that the work can be coordinated.
Take a look also at the Wiki to understand how to do that.
