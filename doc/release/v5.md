# Whole-Body Toolbox (YYYY-MM-DD) Release Notes {[`#v5`](https://github.com/robotology/wb-toolbox/releases/tag/v5)}

The `v5` release of Whole-Body Toolbox brings a big change in the architecture: the core of the toolbox became a standalone repository hosted at [robotology/blockfactory](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory). This repository will only host the plugin library containing the classes of the blocks.

More in detail, this repository now contains only the `WBToolboxBase` and `WBToolboxLibrary` components.

## Important Changes

- The Core, Mex and Coder components have been removed
- New dependency: [robotology/blockfactory](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory)
- It does not depend anymore (neither optionally) from Simulink
