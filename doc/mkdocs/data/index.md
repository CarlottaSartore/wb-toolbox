## Main Goal

> The library should allow non-programming experts or those researchers just getting acquainted with Whole Body Control to more easily deploy controllers either on simulation or real YARP-based robotic platforms, and to analyze their performance taking advantage of the innumerable MATLAB and Simulink toolboxes. We like to call it "rapid controller prototyping" after which a proper YARP module should be made for hard real time performance and final deployment.

The following video shows CoDyCo's latest results on iCub in which the top level controller has been implemented with the [WB-Toolbox](https://github.com/robotology/WB-Toolbox) running at a 10ms rate!
