# Whole Body Toolbox

## A Simulink Toolbox for Whole Body Control

!!! quote ""
    This toolbox allows non-programming experts and researchers approaching _Whole Body Control_ to more easily develop controllers on either simulated or real `YARP`-based robotic platforms.<br>
    Develop to deployment time is minimized by exploiting the rich variety of Simulink's toolboxes and its capabilities on rapid prototyping and visual debugging.

## Who use `WB-Toolbox`

`WB-Toolbox` is used extensively in the controllers stored in @robotology-playground/whole-body-controllers.

This video shows the latest results on the iCub robot achieved in the EU project CoDyCo in which a top level controller implemented with the @robotology/WB-Toolbox achieves a running `100 Hz` rate.
