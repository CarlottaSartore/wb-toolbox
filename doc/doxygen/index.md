# Whole Body Toolbox

### A Simulink Toolbox for Whole Body Control

> This toolbox allows non-programming experts and researchers approaching _Whole Body Control_ to more easily develop controllers on either simulated or real `YARP`-based robotic platforms.<br>
> Develop to deployment time is minimized by exploiting the rich variety of Simulink's toolboxes and its capabilities on rapid prototyping and visual debugging.

## Who use `WB-Toolbox`

`WB-Toolbox` is used extensively in the controllers stored in [robotology-playground/wholeBodyControllers](https://github.com/robotology-playground/wholeBodyControllers).

[This video](https://youtu.be/UXU3KSa201o) shows latest results on the iCub robot achieved in the EU project CoDyCo in which a top level controller implemented with the `WB-Toolbox` achieves a running `100 Hz` rate.
